    (feel free to ask each other, me, or look at an online resource for help, but write it in your own words) <br>
    7/17: Homework: Look online and find an example of a proven math theorem that could have been disproven with a counterexample. <br>
    Take a look at how hard it was to prove.  Also find an open math problem (one we don't know whether is true or false) that<br>
    could hypothetically still be disproven with a counterexample.  Report back to me which problems you chose. <br><br>
    7/22: Do the study guide for the posttest.  You can find it linked here: <a href="2024WestonStudyGuide.pdf">Study Guide</a>, <a href="2024WestonStudyGuideAnswers.pdf">Answers</a>
